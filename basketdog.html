	<div>From director <strong>Vicki Fleming</strong> comes the heartwarming tale of a boy named Pete (Trent Dugson) and his dog Rover 
        (voiced by Brinson Lumblebront). You may think a boy and his dog learnin the true value of friendship sounds familiar, 
        but a big twist sets this flick apart: Rover plays basketball, and he's doggone good at it. </br>
        This movie has everything you could ask for:
        <ul>
            <li>Basketball</li>
            <li>A dog</li>
            <li>Nail-biting suspense</li>
        </ul>
        While it may not have been necessary to include all 150 minutes of Rover's championship game in real time, 
        Basketball Dog will keep your interest for the entirety of its 4-hour runtime, 
        and the end will have any dog lover in tears. If you love basketball or sports pets, this is the movie for you.</br>
